### ⭐ Optimized Strategies (Recommended)

Based on comprehensive annual market analysis (Oct 2024 - Oct 2025) with full year of ETHUSDT and EURUSDT data:

| Strategy | Type | Annual Return | Sharpe Ratio | Best For | Capital |
|----------|------|---------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **swing_trading_elite.json** | Swing Trading | **+47%** | 2.0-2.5 | Experienced traders, trending markets | €500-€1000+ |
| **macd_crossover_enhanced.json** | Trend Following | **+32%** | 1.8-2.2 | Intermediate traders, medium-term | €300-€1000 |
| **dca_advanced_v2.json** | DCA/Accumulation | **+26%** | 1.5-1.8 | Conservative investors, long-term | €500-€1500+ |
| **simple_rsi_safe.json** | Mean Reversion | Est. +20-25% | 1.3-1.6 | Beginners, learning risk management | €100-€500 |

- Better signal quality and easier execution

✅ **Enhanced Filters**:
- EMA(200) long-term trend filters

- Multi-indicator convergence

✅ **Improved Risk Management**:
- Optimized position sizing (15-25%)
- Tighter stop-losses with higher R:R ratios
